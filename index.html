            <h2 class="border-top">About David</h2>


            <p>After graduating college, I became a software engineer and I had been working on all kinds of projects.
                Mostly on the front end, database and network management side of things. I had joined a dry cleaning
                franchise in 2002 and then opened my own dry cleaning company in 2008, which I have been working at to
                this day. To support my business needs, I actively work on coding projects using all kinds of
                technologies. The custom software I created was very easy to use, feature rich and very reliablbe, It
                handling accounts for hundreds of my customers. I found software development very interesting, rewarding
                and challenging. Due to the pandemic, I found myself have much more time than before. Therefore, I would
                like to get my coding skill set more up to date and find a job besides what I am doing now.</p>

            <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>,
                I've learned a lot of techniques to become a much better software developer and I cannot wait to apply
                what I learn to the projects I will be working on.</p>


            <p>In my spare time, I like to go hiking, biking, kayaking, fishing, watch Netflix and football. </p>

            <p>If you're looking to hire a experienced developer, please reach out! I am so excited to work with other
                developers to build great software.</p>
